    "- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed progress tracking and status updates\n",
    "- **Timeout Management**: 5-minute timeout for orchestration completion\n",
    "- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of individual agent failures\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Use Case Example\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook includes a practical example demonstrating the orchestration of claim analysis for \"CL002\", showing how the system processes claim details and retrieves additional data to provide comprehensive multi-agent analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation represents a cutting-edge approach to insurance claim processing, leveraging the power of concurrent AI agents to provide thorough, multi-perspective analysis that would traditionally require multiple human experts working in sequence.\n"

      "Explanation:\n",
      "Based on the policy language, the policy LIAB-AUTO-001 provides coverage only for liability to third parties and does not cover damages to the insured party’s own vehicle or personal injuries. Any claim seeking coverage for repair costs or medical expenses to the insured is not covered under this policy. The insured is responsible for damages that exceed the liability limits specified in the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, when evaluating a claim against this policy, approval should only occur if the claim is within the third-party liability scope—such as injuries or property damage caused to others—and within policy limits. Claims outside this scope or exceeding limits are not covered under this policy language.\n",
      "\n",
      "This detailed coverage and limitation framework leads to a determination that coverage is LIMITED TO THIRD-PARTY LIABILITY ONLY, with no own-vehicle or personal injury coverage provided. Claim evaluation must strictly adhere to these confines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reference: Liability Only Auto Insurance Policy, detailed coverage and exclusions in sections 1, 2.1, 7.3, and 8.1【3:2†liability_only_policy.md】【3:4†liability_only_policy.md】\n",

      "Analysis:\n",
      "- Claim Details: The claim involves a 2004 Honda Accord damaged in a parking lot collision on July 17, 2025. The damage is reported as severe on the front and driver's side, including bumper detachment, dents, wheel/tire damage, paint transfer, and possible mechanical issues. Witness and police reports are included, as well as repair shop estimates and photos.\n",
      "- Documentation: The claim includes multiple attachments—photos of the damage, police report, and repair estimate—indicating strong documentation completeness.\n",
      "- Damage and Cost Estimates: The damage descriptions and attached photos show severe impact consistent with repair estimates generally required for such damage. However, without the actual repair cost figures in the retrieved data, an exact reasonableness check is limited.\n",
      "- Policy Coverage: No specific policy document for \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" was found to verify policy limits, exclusions, or deductibles, making coverage validation incomplete.\n",
      "- Inconsistencies or Red Flags: The claim context and documentation appear consistent. The presence of witness and police report supports claim credibility. The related crash data for a separate claim shows no cross-claim inconsistencies, although it's unrelated to this claim.\n",
      "- Missing Information/Concerns: \n",
      "  1. Absence of explicit repair cost figures or itemized invoice to validate estimate reasonableness.\n",
      "  2. No access to the actual policy documents for \"LIAB-AUTO-001\" means coverage determination is not confirmed.\n",
      "  3. No repair shop or adjuster's damage evaluation narrative to confirm hidden damages or total loss potential.\n",
      "  4. No timeline of claims processing or claimant communication for further procedural assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next Steps:\n",
      "1. Retrieve the full policy document for LIAB-AUTO-001 to verify coverage scope, exclusions, and deductibles.\n",
      "2. Obtain detailed repair cost estimate or invoice from Springfield Auto Body for damage itemization and industry comparison.\n",
      "3. Request an adjuster's damage assessment report to confirm damage extent, repair feasibility, and possible total loss.\n",
      "4. Confirm if claimant has complied with all procedural requirements like timely reporting and documentation submission.\n",
      "5. Based on the above, reassess claim status for approval or further investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current recommendation is to hold approval pending retrieval of repair costs and policy coverage details to ensure claim validity and coverage.\n",
